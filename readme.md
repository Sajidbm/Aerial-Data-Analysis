# Aerial Data Analysis

The purpose of the repo is to generate hybrid datasets that can be used to simulate GPS spoofing. We have already attempted to do this once in the `ZurichUrbanMAVData` folder with 'Zurich Urban MAV Dataset'. You can find elaborate description of my findings on `readmefirst` there. 


## What is the current status of work?

Given the limitations of working with Zurich Urban MAV Dataset, I have moved on to using [Canadian Longterm Outdoor UAV Longterm Dataset (CLOUD)](https://www.dynsyslab.org/cloud-dataset/).
